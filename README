RSG - Ready Set Get!
---------------------------------------

"Ready Set Get!" is a framework created to create an alternative to the current JavaBean naming standards. Instead
of method names like "ent.getXXXX" and "ent.setXXXX" or "ent.isYYYY".  This framework proposes a better standard
"ent.XXXX.get()" and "ent.XXXX.set(xxxx)" or "ent.YYYY.is()".  Additionally moving the field (or property) to a
publicly accessible variable opens up the realm of possibility to attach additional meta-data information about the
field on the instance.  An example, "ent.XXXX.label()" or "ent.XXXX.table()" and "ent.XXXX.column()".  This gives us
a programmatic alternative to static unwieldy annotations.
